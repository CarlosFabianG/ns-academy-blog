# What I did learn - week 7

Created: Nov 15, 2020 10:00 AM

It's week 7 of the NS academy program. During this week with my team we kept building our project. Especifically, the second milestone according to our planning. In this milestone I focused more on the frontend of the project due to I coud practice my javascript skills which was great. 

**Deliberate practice**

Continuing the reading of the book Peak by Andy Ericsson this week I got an important insight. It's more important the quality of your practice than the amount of time spent on it. That's mainly about the importance of focus and concentration while practicing a skill. 

It's hard to maintain a full concentration for a long period of time. So, the moment you feel you a re losing your focused you should take a break. Here it is good idea to apply the time boxing technique and set short but fully focused study and practice sessions. It's more effective 30 min of purposeful practice than three hours of mindless repetition. 

For instance, you could set 25 min and then rest 5 to 10 min and then continue for other round. This technique is also known as Pomodoro. I can tell that it is very effective, mostly to fight against procrastiantion in my case. 

I've been using this technique mostly when learning java and SQL in the last weeks. 

**Javascript**

To me Javascript is to the web as English is to the world. It's sort of the 'langua franca' of the web. 

That is why I commited myself to get pretty proefficient with it. Despite I will be learning a bit of many languages, aside of that, I will keep my training in javascript. According to this goal this weekend I adquired a course where the goal is to re create React library functionalities with vanilla JS. I think that recreating the abstractions of a framework or library with just the laguage is one the best ways to understand those technologies, in this case React. 

Thus, I will be sharing my learnings and insights of JS in the next weeks. 

**Redux**

Once I read that every React developer should know how to use Redux. Thus, I wanted to dive into it. **What is it exactly?**

If you have developed with react you know that every component have its own state and they can share state through props in a herarchichal way - from parents to children. If the application is small there's no problem with that way. However, in large applications it becomes complex in terms of scability and maintance. 

Redux helps with that, it is a Javascript library that allows you to have a global state in your application so any component can access to it.

The project we are building with my team uses Redux in the frontend. I had learned the principles of redux in the past and play a bit with it but I hadn't used it in a real project or with React either. 

Solving a problem this week I learned something really important with Redux and with development in general which I explain next. 

**If you are struggling go back to the fundamentals**

This week I learned that when working on an issue o solving a bug if you spend more than an hour you might have lacking some fundamental understanding so you should go back to the fundamentals of what you are doing. 

For instance, this week I was struggling with an update data in the frontend of our application. After trying some solutions for half a day realized that I was lacking some fundamental understanding of react-redux which is a node package that allow us to use react con redux. it's like the bridge between them. 

Due to this I decided to go back and undertand a couple of APIs of react-redux. I went to [freecodecamp.org](http://freecodecamp.org) and I did the react-redux small express course which took me around an hour straight. Once, I undersatnd what **mapStateToProps** and **mapDispatchToProps** I went back to our project and solved the problem in half and hour. 

This was a great lesson 

**Last thoughts**

We have one week left of the second phase of the NS program. There's still so much to do. Hard work, learning and fun have been the constants in this phase. But most important, ithe journey has, so far, been pretty rewarding. The next week will be critical in the development of our project. At the moment, we have great progress and we are on time with the initial plan. However, there are great challenges ahead, so there's still so much fun. Let's see how it goes. 

See you all next weeks.
