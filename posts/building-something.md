# What I did learn - week 5

We are starting phase two of the Nearsoft academy program where we have to build something from scratch in teams. To be honest I am so excited about the next weeks since I will be programming with my peers. And most important, as in the last weeks, I'll be sharing here my insights and learnings of each week. 

**Peak**

One of the benefits of being part of the academy program is that you have access to a library full of greats books. "So many books so little time" was what I thought when I saw the list available. 

To take advantage of this I committed myself to read more books that the ones we are asked during the program. This week I started reading the book Peak "Secrets from the New Science of Expertise" by Anders Ericsson. The main thesis of the author is to show with a scientific approach that you can develop proficiency in any skill by training and practice. But, not any kind of practice. 

The main focus of the book is the idea of the deliberate practice as the key to make anyone to develop extraordinary capabilities. 

The book is going great so far, Ericsson is one the major experts in learning and performance research fields. You can apply years of research through the strategies and tactics in the book to improve your skills. It is a good deal I think. 

**Java** 

Being honest it wasn't in my plans to learn Java language but I started with it a couple of weeks ago. To solve a challenge that was part of my assignments of that week I needed to know the basics of it: its syntax and the environment around. Thus, I took an express course online for three days and that was it. 

I thought I was done with Java but during this phase I will need it so this week I was back on track. Day by day it has started to make sense on me and I think I like it and I feel determined to dive deeply into it. What excites me the most about it is that a large part of the software infrastructure, globally speaking, is running on Java. Also, It is not that hard as I had been told. And, it is great to get the Oriented Object Programming paradigm. 

**Anki Cards**

The main goal of the first phase in the academy is to get the tools to optimize our learning process. In this industry you need to be learning continually, quickly and effectively thus you have to be  continually optimizing your learning system. 

I think that having an optimized learning system is one the best things you can do to gain confidence as a developer. You never will know everything but you know that you can learn anything quickly. Thus, it is worth to invest the right time on improving this meta-skill.

In this phase I will need several of those tools since I have to learn a lot. In the book "Make it stick" which I read last month it is mention the importance of test yourself and also of retrieving knowledge so you can move what you have just learned from the working memory to the long-term memory. 

Anki Cards method is a great resource to apply the recalling and retrieving knowledge so I will be using it next weeks, mostly to understand complex subjects like continuous integration, relational databases, java syntax among others.

**Time boxing** 

This is a management technique where you have to set a time for doing a specific task. it works specially for meetings. We all know that a meeting can turn into unproductive time easily, so if you set a limit you are more prone to get the most of it. It is also good for focus and avoid procrastination. And example of this technique can be the pomodoro one. Individually I use it in my exercises when learning a language, a new tool or some theoretic topic; it really helps for focus. 

 

**User stories**

A user story is an informal and general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. It is a key of agile software development. 

User stories are few sentences in simple language that outline the desire outcome. They don't go into detail. Its main purpose is to articulate how piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the customer. 

This practice have the benefit of making the development team to focus on the users. Also, it enables collaboration and drives creative solutions. 

During this week with my team we had to formulate and write down the user stories of the project we are building.

 I realized the importance of them since the exercise of putting yourself on the feet of the regular user of an application helps you to clarify what you have to build. 

**Last thoughts** 

This week was  great, I had to put on practice much of the learnings of the phase 1, also I learned about how to set up a project from scratch, agile practices like user stories and time boxing for team meetings. 

I cannot wait for the next week when I will be getting touching code most of the time. So let's see how it goes.
