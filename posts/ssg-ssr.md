**Introduction**

It's week 2 of the Nearsoft Academy Program. We are diving into more technical content and getting our hands dirty with code. But, just as important as hard skills it's the mentality and attitude of a software engineer. Therefore, in this week  we covered both parts that every great professional needs. I want to share my insights, learnings and reflections from this week. 

 Let's start by getting down some myths and wrong ideas in the software industry.   

**The myth of the genius programmer** 

In our culture we love the myth of the solo genius who work alone for days and nights and suddenly appears when an invention that changes the world. Perhaps, this could be true in the world of fine arts but in programming it's just not like that. 

Writing software that is successful, it's an inherently collaborative activity. 

How can we collaborate with other people effectively? 

Here are some ideas to get this.

**Loses ego**

Since first week in the academy we were asked to read the book 

**Criticism is not Evil**

Giving constructive criticism is a skill that can be learned, as well as receive criticism well. We need to allow ourselves to be vulnerable and look for feedback continually. At the same time, we need to empathize with others we are giving our feedback to.  

**Embrace failure**

Failure is always an option except in one case - failing in the same thing repeatedly. Because this means you are not learning. To many people, failing is the best way to learn, including myself.

When failure happens be ready for it. And most importantly - learn from it.

**Iterate quickly**

 Always remember that the faster you can fail and the faster you can iterate, the faster you will learn. 

**Be a small fish**

If you're the senior developer in your company it could be very comfortable but you would not be learning pretty much. This is like the apprenticeship pattern "Be the worst". Remember, if you are the best engineer in the team you are in the wrong team. 

**Be influenced** 

The more you are open to new ideas and new ways to look at something the more you will have influence in a team. An important hack to apply this is simple: make your teammates know that you listen to them. 

**Be vulnerable** 

This related in some way with the last one. If you can admit your mistakes in front of your peers, they will trust you. This is about losing the ego as well. Allow yourself to fail and learn from it. 

**Social Skills for Geeks**

When someone -outside of the tech world- think about a programmer they might have in mind a young introvert who spend all of his days and nights alone coding an playing video games in his room; who is very smart but also with poor social skills- it has just pop on my mind the main character of Mr Robot.

However, in the real world If you want to be a successful engineer you need to focus on your social skills not just in the technical. 

**Personal behavior**

If you are working in a team you need to have interactions with the other members of your team. You have to be able to receive feedback from them. 

Also it is very important to have a proactive attitude. Don't wait your manager to tell you what to do, instead look for things you can do. 

Learning to talk with no tech people is a skill that can be learned. It's something we can put effort on.  

**Social dynamics of being at a team**

It is not only about oneself. Every team has its own dynamic that it is the sum of the culture, rules, attitude and behavior of every member.  This dynamic tends to perpetuate itself and it attracts people who have such the same values that can fit with the culture of the team.

Therefore, it is important that the members of a team protect their culture. 

**The art of organizational manipulation** 

As we all know companies area about people and in software companies, specifically, talented people is the more important asset. Therefore, it is a smart idea to know how to manage an organization of people and guide their efforts and talent. 

There is a talk by Brian Fitzpatrick, Ben Collins-Sussman who are both managers in google where they  teach us how they work in google. I think it's worth to take a look at these ideas and reflect about them even if your goal it's not to become a manger this will help to recognize good organizations you can develop your potential. 

**The ideal**

The first thing you have to do is to stop thinking in terms of management and start thinking in terms of leadership. 

What do you need to take your job done?

What do you need to have when working?

Pursue responsibility

Communicate well

**Take risks**

when you are in a company where you are allowed to take risks you can fail faster. What does this mean? you can learn faster. 

Reaching this point we need to know that although last points were about the ideal  most of the time the ideal is not aligned with reality. Life is not fair so to speak. Let's take a look to what it means to be a bad manager.

**The reality** 

Surveys show that 50 per cent of happiness at work depends of your manager. 

- Too conservative
- Ignores low performance
- Office politician

**Bad organizations**

- **Unrealistic expectations**

This can push so much pressure in the members of the team which is counterproductive in terms of creativity and productivity. Also, there is risk to bourn the team out. 

- **Not trust**

How could a company ask for ownership to their employees if they don't trust them. 

- **Directional chaos**

This is the kind of company where there is too much of political power struggles. Many bosses, very hierarchical, with no a clear direction. I don't think this is optimal to stimulate creativity.

A good manager is the one who protects their team from chaos so they can get their work done.

**The manipulation - How to survive in a toxic environment?** 

**Ask for permission forgiveness not permission** 

If you know what it's the right thing to do, what it needs to be done, It's worth the risk. Many times this is the only way to get things done. This is what responsibility and ownership mostly are about in an organization. The only rule here is don't do what you can undo and be prepared to back up.

**Choose your battles wisely**

There is a waste of energy, resources and time for not choosing well your battles. Reserve you political capital in an organization to fight the battles that worth. 

**Make influential friends**

There are people who are connectors in company. They can introduce you to new people. It is a good idea to be close to them, to have them as friends. 

**Face time** 

We have available amazing tools to communicate remotely with other people. However, it is so important to face-to-face with your teammates and other people of the company. That is what Pixar did when designed their offices to stimulate randomly face-to-face between teams and areas of the company. 

**Find a safe haven** 

Perhaps things are not going well in your team. When this happens for so long remember you can always find another team where you can fit in. 

**Upward perception**

What other people perceive of your work is important. People see the world behind their perception so you need to learn to handle how your work looks like for people outside of your team.

**What do you think creativity is about?** 

The next subject I want to cover in this essay is very interesting to me.

 Let's start with some questions.

Do you see yourself as a creative person?

Do you think being creative is something someone was born with?

What do you need to do something original?

**Everything is a remix**

Most of us have a misconception of what it takes to create something original. We see a "original" creation as if it is something very unique and was made with some divine inspiration by some genius.

However If we look at pop culture as the movie and music industry we can see that everything is supported by what it was created before. In other words, everything is as a remix of existing creations.

The key word here is remix.

**What does remix mean?**

To combine or editing existing material to produce something new.

Therefore we can say that creativity is based on remixing. Every creation requires influence from something else. 

**Elements of creativity**

 Ordinary tools of thought to existing material. 

**Copy**

Since we are born we are copying everything. Nothing can be pure original.

**Transform** 

Once we learn to copy we can make transformations of that to produce interesting things. 

**Combine** 

Connecting ideas together from different. 

We can summarize all of this with what Henry Ford once said

"I invented nothing new. I simply assembled the discoveries of other men behind whom were centuries of work..progress happens when all the factors that make for it are ready and then it is inevitable".

**Developing expertise**

Software is written by people. You can have the best methodologies but the people working in the project is the main factor to get the expected results. 

In a team there is a range of experience and expertise among all the members and this is something to keep in mind. We have in a team novices as well as experts and even wizards of code.  

For instance, when you are a novice you gain experience by exposing yourself to knowledge, you need rules and procedures. When you are getting expertise you gain intuition. Intuition is knowing something without how you know it. For instance, when an expert is trying to solve a problem they could be al day thinking about it and no getting solved then go to sleep just to wake up the next day with the solution in their head. 

What are the stages from novice to an expert in software development?

**Stage 1** - **Novice**

When you are a novice you need to be told what to do next and short term goals. You cannot take decisions by your own and you need supervision. 

**Stage 2 - Advance Beginner**

In this stage you start trying tasks on their own. You can consume information faster.  Your start making associations and to formulate some principles but without holistic understanding. You still cannot troubleshoot problems by your own. 

**Stage 3 - Competent** 

When you reach certain competence you can develop conceptual models. You start solving problems by your own and need less supervision. 

**Stage 4 - Proficient** 

When you get proficiency in your craft you want to understand the larger conceptual framework. Learn from the experience of others. you can understand and apply. You will self-correct previous poor task performance. 

**Stage 5 - Expert** 

Experts are the primary sources of knowledge and information. Continually look for better methods. Work primarily from intuition, not reason. Forcing them to follow set rules degrades performance. 

---

Every person depends on what stage they have different needs. They cannot be treated the same. 

For instance an expert requires the big picture. A novice that big picture is not that useful. They need context-free rules to be more productive. 

The most majority of people are in stage 2 - not just in software industry but in general. A rule is that people used to over estimate in which stage they are. 

For instance, the difference between stage 2 and 3 is taking risks by yourself. However, not so much people are motivated to do it. A person needs to be passionate about their work to take risks. 

**Here are some keys to change:**

Experience makes us valuable. Thus, in order to progress in our career in the software industry we need an investment portfolio as it it were a financial one. 

**Have a plan**

You need to have a clear vision of the kind of developer you want to become. Thus, you can design your roadmap that will get you there step by step. 

**Diversify** 

As in a financial portfolio don't put all your money in something instead have both low and high risk investments. For instance, to learn a new language is low risk that has low return. Learning a new programming paradigm could be high risk but it have the potential to have massive return. 

**Look for a value**

How can I do my job better? How can I deliver more to the final product? These are questions to need to ask to yourself to find ways to always add value to your work. 

**Are active, not passive**

Review what you are doing constantly. if not, it could be easy to get lost in your way. So, invest a couple of hours every week to know where you are and if you are in the right path.

**Invest regularly** 

 Don't give the company you work for the responsibility to train you. You are building is your own ability to survive. You need to invest your money and time. Have and schedule and stick to it.

**Patterns**

**Linda Rising** is an expert in patterns, changes, , how people solve problems and how the brain works. She has written several books in these topics. Also, she's an international speaker. 

Linda has a series of talks that are completely amazing and, from my point of view, totally mind blowing. She mixes her knowledge in computer science, cognitive psychology, evolutionary biology to give us insights on why Agile development is the right way to go. 

These topics can be very helpful for us in terms of how we see can improve our lives and careers understating how our brains work and how interact with others. 

**The power of an agile mindset**

There are two kinds of mindsets people can have. The one you have determines how your outcome in life will be. 

A person with a fixed mindset is the one who thinks that they is the way it is and cannot change. For instance, if they found hard to understand math in school they might think it is because the are not smart enough so they stop making an effort to understand this topic for the rest of their lives. They just weren't born for that. 

On the other hand, a person with an agile mindset could see that same case just as a matter of practice, effort and time. It could be hard for them as well, but improving day by day they will eventually get it. 

As we see in these examples, a person with a fixed mindset avoid challenge, they think they are not smart enough and they can't change that, so it's not worth to try it. it's not worth that investment of time and effort. 

On the contrary, the agile mindset is an an attitude towards effort, growing, learning, improving. A person with this attitude is the one who thinks: Although, I wasn't born with a great ability or talent  I can substitute them with practice and patient. I can always get better. 

Here we have more examples of the differences between these mindsets. 

                                                        **Fixed vs Agile**

**Fixed**

**Agile**

**Ability** -static, like hight

**Ability** -can grow, like a muscle

**Goal** - look good

**Goal** - to learn

**Challenge** - avoid

**Challenge** - embrace

**Failure** - defines your identity

**Failure** - provides information

**Effort** - for those with no talent

**Effort** - path to mastery

**Reaction to challenge** - helplessness

**Reaction to challenge** - resilience

These both mindsets are not just about individuals but as well organizations, teams, groups and son on.

An example of the agile mindset in a company is Southwest airlines. They say they are a company of people not airplanes. These are one of their principles in their hiring politics.

- Hire for attitude
- Establish a culture of community, trust, and the "Southwest spirit"
- Then provide learning opportunities and continually grow people

**Education**

Unfortunately, the traditional education system in most countries is an example of a system with a fixed mindset. Students are't encourage to fail and learn from their mistakes, unlike they are labeled by the results they get in standardized tests. This is bad because a student who wasn't successful in this system can think he is stupid for the rest of his life. 

A good education it is the one where students are taught to fail effectively. 

Having an agile minset is a choice. These rules are a good start:

- Effort is good
- Ask about the work
- Praise the effort
- Don't label people

**Prejudices Can Alter Team Work**

We as humans are very hardwire to be very judgmental. Most of the times we do it unconsciously. This could be bad because once we have a judgement about someone we see them behind it. It works like a filter. Therefore, we can say we distort reality based on our ideas of others. 

**Us and them**

In order to survive we humans evolve to form groups. That shapes the identity of every person in it. That's why we used to judge people from other gropus  based on obvious and trivial characteristics such as race, nationality, religion, genre, etc. 

Throghu social experiments psycologist have discovered that we are hardwired to have a hostile attitude and behaviour towards the people from other groups even if we barely know something about them. This could be discouraging in the sense that we might think that it is the way we are as a specie and we can't change that. However in these experiemtns scientist also have found out that if there is a challenge larger than the self-interest of a specific group, people from different groups can join to work together in oreder to survive. 

In history we have seen that this is true for people, teams and citizens. 

The lesson is that if we have a challenge larger than us we can colaborate to each other effectevely despite our trivial differences. 

**Perfection is an unrealistic goal**

We are hardwire to go around in cycles. 

**The agile way**

Our brains evolves to survive in the stone age. This explains most of our behavior and other automatic functions as the way we sleep. 

We are not design to be linear. For instance, during a day we are fluctuating between low energy and high energy. 

We are under the illusion that being more productive means multi-tasking and working for a long periods of time. 

If you're in IT your capacity for focus is critical. Emails, notifications, social media drain your cognitive power. The optimal is 90 mins. More will decrease your productivity.

Researchers used to think that our brain was almost fully developed when we were born but this is not true. We can build our brain at any time of our lives. It depends on the way you live. 

Here is where we can experiment and iterate, in other words be agile. 

- Read a different kind of books.
- Go new places
- Play
- Look for different things

According to Linda Rise the Agile development is aligned with the way our brains are hardwired. For instance,  we feel more comfortable working with small teams because, from evolutionary biology perspective, it was the way humans evolve - sitting around a cave and telling stories to each other.

It seems that Agile methodology with all of its rituals is 

The work and conferences of Linda has caused a deep impact on me. It makes me realize I need to improve and change some attitude and believes in order to have an agile mindset. There is a lot work to be done. There is a lot to learn. And, It is a path with no ending.

**Technical stuff**

**Perfmatters**

Have you ever navigate into a website that it is so slow that you choose to go back rather than stayed and wait to it renders?

Well, this is about performance but it's not  

There are three steps to performance tooling

1.**Gathering**

We can't improve what we can't measure. So, the first step is to gather metrics of what's happening when the right tools. 

**2.Insight** 

Data by itself it's not that useful if we don't analyze it and get insights from it in order to make a roadmap with the steps to follow to improve those metrics. 

**3.Action**

Once we have our roadmap we need to execute it. If not, the two last steps were kind of worthless. 

**3 pillars of web performance** 

- Network

**How to optimaze it** 

Optimize Critical Path

- Render

Reduce paint

- Compute

Reduce JS execution time

**Tools and scripting in the shell bash**

Last week I shared some of the basic commands of the bash terminal that you can use to create directories, subdirectories, files, configurations and so on. Actually, we have access to all of the resources of the computer from the terminal as long as you have the administrator permissions. 

Besides all of those actions, we can make scripts as well to automate tasks. Shell scripting languge is optimize to do shell-related tasks as saving results into files, reading standard input. 

This is the sintax basics:

**Variables**

```bash
# to declare a variable
foo=bar
```

**Printing values**

```bash
foo=bar
echo "$foo"
# prints bar
echo '$foo'
# prints $foo
```

**Conditionals** 

```bash
if [ $index -lt 5 ]
then
  echo $index
else
  echo 5
fi
```

**For loops**

```bash
for file in $files
do
  echo $file
done
```

**Accesing external files in our script**

```bash
#to get all the files in a directory
files=/some/directory/*

#to iterate through each file and do something
for file in $files
do
  echo $file
done
```

Even tough I knew that you can make scripts in your terminal with a bash language scripting I have never played with it.  Now, I see this can be really helpful so I will be trying it for automating tasks which is what I interested the most to do with it. 

**Data structures** 

Data structures are the way we store and retrieve data in a piece of software and they were design pretty similar to real-world systems.   They are the essential building blocks that we use to organize all of our digital information. 

**Queue**

A queue is a linear data structure that only adds data to the tail, and removes it from the head of the queue. We think about a queue as a line in a grocery store. The person at the front gets to leave the line first, and every person who joins the line has to join in the back.

```jsx
class Queue {

  constructor(){
      this._queue = []
  }
//add an item to the head
  enqueueCharacter(item){
      this.queue.push(item)
  }
//remove item from the tail
   dequeueCharacter() {
       return this.queue.pop()
   }
}
```

**Stack**

A stack is a linear data structure that only allows data to be added or removed from the "top" of the stack. We could make an analogy of a pile(stack) of books. If we want to add a book we have to put it onto the pile of books; when we want one we can only pick up the book that is on the top. 

An example in the real world could be a browser's back and forwad function. 

This is an example of a stack in javascript using class sintax. 

```jsx
class Stack {
  constructor() {
    this._books = [];
  }
//we add a new book to
  push(newBook) {
    this._books.push(newBook);
  }
// we remove a book from the head of our array
  remove() {
    return this._books.shift();
  }
}
```

Finally, I want to share a sketch I made to represent the basics of variables length code which is a code that maps source symbols to a variable number of bits. This allows us to compressed and decompressed data with zero error. 

**One last thing**

It's Saturday night and I reflect upon how fast the week has over. As well as how much content I've seen so far. Although it was a challenge to complete my assignments I am optimistic about what it is ahead. There will be so much learning and growth as a developer and professional overall. 

Every video and article that I watched and read has make think a lot about myself. I think they have helped me to have a clear vision on what I need to work on to improve. Also, I realized how important it is to be sorraound by a great team.
