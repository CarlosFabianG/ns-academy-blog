# Make it stick

Since basic school we were told about the importance of learning. It is necessary to have a good life and be useful in society, our teachers and parents used to say to us. We were always told the importance of school and learning but we weren't told that much how to actually learn. if learning is that important then there must be an optimize way of doing it. 

Learning by itself is a skill. More accurate, we can refer to it as a meta-skill. *"Meta"* comes from the ancient greeks *"metha"* and literally means "about", thus we can say that it is about the skill to get others skills. 

Due to this, we can see that it is a smart idea to know the best ways to acquire others skills more easily, and this is what the book make it stick is about: to optimize our process of learning by learning how to learn.

In the book we are shown concrete techniques that have been scientifically proved to increment the effectiveness of our study habits and practices. 

Many of the common practices might be counterproductive and a waste of time. For instance, highlight what you are reading can give you the illusion of knowledge. Another example is re-reading. Or what about when you follow your math teacher doing an equation and understanding it  just to see later that you can't do it by yourself. 

I remember to use all this methods during school. I see know that there are much better ways to study so our time is better invested. 

if we use the right methods, practices and techniques we can become much better learners. As we are in an industry, software development, where we need to be constantly learning this becomes a critical advantage to stand out. 

Now I am going to share some of the techniques that can dramatically improve the effectiveness per hour of study. 

**Retrieval practice** 

This refers to the practice of self-quizzing. When we are studying by ourselves we can fall into the trap to rereading, but as I said before this is ineffective and makes us to think we know and understand when we don't.  

When we see a new material, concept or lesson we can ask ourselves these questions?

What are the key ideas?

What terms of ideas are new to me?

How would I define them?

How do the ideas relate to what I already know?

Questions are many times more important than answers because they frame our ideas. So, we have to learn to make the right questions before focusing in the answers. 

It is important to be aware that the harder it is for you to recall new learning from memory, the greater the benefit of doing so. We can say that it is like working out in the gym. If there's no pain, there's no gain. 

**Spaced retrieval practice**

It means to study information leaving considerable time between practice sessions. This helps to mobilize knowledge from the working memory to the long-term memory. For instance, you could take a quiz minutes after you read an information but it would much more effective if you take the quiz a day after, even a week and a month after. 

As it sounds this is much harder to do but the results are astonishing. 

Another example is to interleave topics in your study sessions. For instance, in software engineering you could be studying a designed pattern  topic and then switching up to a feature in some language. Also, this could help you to make associations among the topics which as we see later it is necessary to see the big picture that ends in better learning.  

This practice might sound counterintuitive but as we have seen intuitive and common practices in learning are, actually, the best ones. 

**Elaboration**

Researching and reading about a new concept and then try to explain it in your own words. This is why teaching is superb way of learning. 

Also, this is why in the software community always is recommended to have a blog where you can explain to others what you have learned recently. 

**Generation**

In the internet there are hundreds of tutorials to make applications with different technologies, frameworks and tools. Imagine how effective it wold be to try to get to the solution by yourself and only then watch the tutorial. This is what generation is about, trying to solve a problem before being shown the answer or the solution. 

It is hard in the beginning but when you see the results it is worth the effort. 

Another way to called generation is learn by doing. It is in trend right know, in innovative education, due to its effectiveness. 

**Reflection**

I like this one, it refers to the act to review what you have learned and ask yourself. For instance, on weekends you could see what you have learned during the week. How many hours you invest learning how effective they were. You can even write an essay reflecting of what you learned which is what we do in the academy program every week. 

When you reflect objectively about your learning there will be always room for improvement and optimization.  Optimizing your studying practices is like sharping your ax . if you spend the right amount of time and effort on it It will be easier to cut the tree later.

**Calibration** 

It is related with the last one. it means to review objectively through tests the areas where you are weak so you can focus on improving them. This is another way to avoid the illusion of knowledge. You could think that you understand well something but until you test it you can be sure about it. Once you are aware that you do not know something as you thought you can work to solve it. 

During the reading of this book which was open-eyed to me, I reflected about my studying habits in school, and, to tell you the truth they were no the best. The good thing is that never is too late to change and to improve. So, with these new, let's say, tools I am ready to the challenges, in terms of learning, ahead.
