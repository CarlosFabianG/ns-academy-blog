We are in week 15 of the Nearsoft academy program. This was the first week of the phase which is about building your personal brand. During this phase, we will be working on our CV, LinkedIn profile, and in general, in the way, we show our professional profile. But most important is that we are going to prepare to interview processes. So it will be a phase of lots of studying.

As I've been doing, I'm going to share with you my takeaways and learnings of the week.

### Interface

We can see an interface like a menu of an abstraction.

When we are in a restaurant we are given the menu of what the place offers. However, we don't have access to the kitchen or know how the meals are prepared either. So we can say that we don't know the implementation of what we are requesting.

Application Programming Interface is about communicating and using a software component as an abstraction. In software development, the term API is often used in different contexts but the key concept of any API is the interface. 

### **Recursion**

Recursion is a strategy for solving problems. In general, it means a function that includes an invocation of the function within its own body. Due to this, we can say that recursion define a problem in terms of itself.

A recursive approach requires the function invoking itself with different arguments. This is possible since programming languages use a stack data structure called call-stack. It tracks the ordering of different function invocations: the last function to enter the stack is the first function to exit it.

**Base case**

This part is a condition that needs to be reached to make the recursive process to stop.

**Recursion step**

This section calls the function that brings us closer to the base case.

The recursive approach has the advantage over an iterative loop that it is more readable for humans. So we can say that we use recursion to make our code easier to read.

### **Algorithms**

An algorithm is a step-by-step process to achieve some outcome.

An algorithmic implementation has three main parts: commands, repetition, conditionals.

Also, they allow you to think about computation independently of the limitations of a specific computer or programming language.

Specifically this week I study the algorithm called binary search. 

**Binary Search**

This algorithm uses an strategy called divide and conquer which consists on breaking a problem into smaller parts. In this case we split a problem into two even parts . 

Its input is a sorted list of elements. If an element you're looking for is in that list, binary search returns the position where it's located. If not, it returns null. 

### Last thoughts

We just started the second half of the Nearsoft - Encora academy program. After this week I know that I need to fill some gaps I have in my fundamental knowledge of computer science and software engineering. But at the same time, I'm aware that learning is not a linear process. We have to keep learning and practicing even if we feel we are not getting it. Also, it is important to keep improving our learning methods, always there is room to improve. And, optimizing our learning process will help every time we need to learn something quickly.
