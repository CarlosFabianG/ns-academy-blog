We are in the 14th week of the Nearsoft / encora academy program. This week was sort of free since the fourth phase is going to begin next week. I decided to study the fundamentals of CS science, as I've done in the last months I would like to share my takeaways and insights of the week.

### Data structures

Once Linus Torlvads said:

The difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.

Due to this, we can see the importance of the subject to be a good developer. So this week I continued my study of this amazing world of data structures. Specifically, I learned about Hash maps, Queues, and Stacks.

Let's see what they are one by one.

### Queues

Queues is a linear collection of nodes that adds data (nodes) to the tail and it removes nodes from the head. We can think about a queue as the line in the bank. People that arrive need to join on the back. And the first people to go are the ones at the beginning of the line.

This data structure has mainly two methods.

- Enqueue - adds data to the back of the queue.
- Dequeue - removes data from the beginning of the queue.
- Peek - returns data from the front of the queue without removing it.

Queues have a FIFO structure: First In, First Out.

### Stacks

It is a linear collection of nodes. It adds data to the head of the stack. When you want to return or remove data you do it from the top as well. We can think in a pile of books. Or in the stack, you set the weights in the gym.

Stacks have three methods:

- Push - adds a new node to the head or top of the stack.
- Pop - removes and returns data from the top of the stack.
- Peek - returns data from the top of the stack without removing it.

A stack can be implemented using a linked list. You must be careful to not push data when it is full since it can result in a stack overflow. if you attempt to remove data when it is an empty result in a stack underflow.

### **Hash Maps**

A hash map is a kind of table with two columns that express a relationship between them. It has a key and a value. Every key that is used can only be the key to a single value in order to be a "map".

### **Last thoughts**

This was the last week of the year. As we all know 2020 was hard for everyone. There were many forced changes in our lives. Also, it has been a year of a lot of reflection.

Last days I have been thinking that It is important to keep the focus and become a better academy. There are lots of challenges ahead. Perhaps, the most difficult part of the academy is just coming. I don't know. But that's why I think I need to work smarter than I have been so far. Knowing when it is time to take a break so I can recharge my batteries. Using more of the tools we learned in phase one.

Let's see what both the next year and the phase of the program has for us.
