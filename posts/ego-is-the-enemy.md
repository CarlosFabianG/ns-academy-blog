# Ego is the enemy

During the first phase of the academy program we were asked to read two books. One of them is actually by one of my favorite authors. 

I have been a fan of Ryan Holiday's writings from the last couple of years. Thanks to him I met the stoic philosophy which I see as an operating system that helps you to handle the difficulties of the modern life. 

In the past I had read ***Obstacle is the way*** and ***Stillness is the key***; the one there was left to complete the stoic trilogy was ***Ego is the enemy*** which is the one I was asked to read and the one I want to talk about in this post.

W**hat's ego?**

During my life time I have seen many smart people, family and friends, making big mistakes and poor decisions that seem unreasonable from the outside. What could have made them to decide and act in that way? 

They are not supposed to be smart?

I used to reflected about it and then I realized I have the same patterns of behavior. Being honest the biggest mistakes I have made in life were for the same reason. 

What I have seen in myself and in others when failing is ego. 

Ryan defines ego like this:

> "An unhealthy belief in our own importance...It’s that petulant child inside every person, the one that must get their way. The need to be better than, more than, recognized for, far past any reasonable utility—that’s ego. It’s the sense of superiority and certainty that exceeds the bounds of confidence and talent. It’s when the notion of ourselves and the world grows so inflated that it begins to distort the reality that surrounds us. When, as the football coach Bill Walsh explained, “self-confidence becomes arrogance, assertiveness becomes obstinacy, and self-assurance becomes reckless abandon.”

Therefore, even if we are not aware, I mean, specially if we are not aware ego is something that hurts us. It doesn't allow us to have a fulfill life and healthy relationships with others. 

Also, our ego doesn't enable us to learn from our mistakes because when we are blind by it we are never wrong. We transfer the responsibility of our actions to external circumstances and to others. 

If we are never wrong how can we analyze and reflect about our actions, iterate and do it better next time?

When we are driven by our ego we live for the claps of others. 

Being looking for external validation makes too hard to choice the better for the long run. We want the rewards now. We cannot wait. We crave for the recognition. That decision-making framework  just ensures us poor choices.  

**What can we do to avoid ego?**

The book is structure mainly in three parts: inspire, success and failure that are the stages every goal oriented person will eventually go thorough. In each one Ryan gives us many actions through lessons of historic characters we can do to avoid being driven by our ego; as he says "you ego is not some power you're forced to satiate in every turn. It can be managed. It can be directed".

Due to this, I want to talk about the three of them that resonates on me the most.  

**Become a student** 

What if you were hired by one of the most successful rock bands in the world as the lead guitar? 

Would you keep improving your technique or you would just enjoy your success?

What if you got your dream's job?

Would you look for a mentor with much more experienced than you or you would think there is none better than you?

What if your startup had an explosive initial success?

Would you look for advice from more experience entrepreneurs or would you feel you are the most smart and bold entrepreneur in the world? 

Well, those are questions to helps us have perspective on what it means to be a student even in success or in the other way around how we can feel we already get there. Our ego can disconnect us from reality. Making us think we are infallible and know everything. 

The pretense of knowledge is our most dangerous vice, because it prevent us from getting any better. Studious self-assessment is the antidote.

We don't like to think that there is a lot left to learn. 

This is why is so important to always have close to you someone better who you can learn from. 

The temptation will always be - I've made it, I already arrived. 

A real student is also his own teacher and his own critic. 

In this term is also the art of taking feedback. We have to actively ask for it because it is to easy to think we are doing great. But we are always a step from falling apart. This is way it is better stay humble and be always a student open to feedback, being aware that there's always room for learning. 

**What's important to you?**

Be careful of not lose sight of what it is important to you. 

We need to be careful in saying yes unthinkingly to feed our vanity.  

Ryan talked about **the an ancient greek word ***euthymia***: it is the sense of our own path and how to stay on it without getting distracted by all the others that intersect it. 

It is easy to deviate from the path so we  have to sit down and think what it is important to us. 

Also we have to be aware that In order to get what we really want we have to sacrifice other things. So, we must choose. Life requires those trade-offs, but ego can't allow it. Ego want it all. 

By reflecting on what it is important to us, we can easily make those choices. We can avoid making choices driven by our ego. 

**The effort is enough**

If you are doing the right thing and you are not rewarded for it doesn't matter. 

Ego is going to look for validation and recognition but the truth is that we have minimal control over what others think and do. 

Therefore, it is better when doing a good job is sufficient by itself. No need for rewards and claps.

All of us will fail sometimes. 

We will lose. 

But as John Wooden once said:

> Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do your best to become the best that you are capable of becoming.

As developers nothing can affect us as our ego. So, we need to be aware of it to not let it to manage our lives. Staying humble, being an student, remain a student mentality, focusing in the effort not i the outcome are some ways to defeat our ego because it is our only enemy.
