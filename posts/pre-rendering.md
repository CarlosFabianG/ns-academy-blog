What it means to be a great professional nowadays?

 What are the basis of a good developer in changing and quickly evolving industry?

How much an idea by itself is worth?

These questions are what the Nearsoft academy program is about during the second week. 

Through this essay I want to share some of my learnings and reflections from the material, classes, and workshops I got into during the week. All of this is going to be mostly about people, creativity, change, ideas and some technical stuff. 

**Self-transcendence**

As humans we have two levels to see reality: the profane and the sacred. Jonathan Haidt who is a social scientist explains in a TED talk that our sacred level of perceived reality is related with a group natural selection. This is why he calls humans  Homo Duplex. And, to have a meaningful existence we have fulfill both. 

We are social animals, to survive we need cooperation among peers. Tribes where their peers did not cooperate couldn't survive. This is why it's part of our natural instinct to do our activities with others to achieve larger enterprises. Just as bees building together a hive. 

All of this said, in order to find satisfaction and meaning in our lives we need to look for being part of something bigger than ourselves and work along others to get what would be impossible for just an individual. 

I think this explains the open source movement in the software development industry. Tons of developers around the world contributing and working together to make large projects. 

**How to master anything** 

Once I read in a book called "Outliers" by Malcom Gladwell about the ten thousand rule to mastery. Which refers to the fact that to master any craft you need to invest ten thousands hours of practice. He uses as an example of this rule a young Bill Gates and his tons of hours coding  since middle school; and this explained his level of expertise for coding in his early 20's. 

However, some experts refuse this hypothesis an give a wider vision of what it takes to master a skill. One of those is Anders Ericsson whom published a book called: Peak "How to master anything"

**it is not about the total of hours of practice but the quality of it** 

You could practice years and years yet just improve a little. 

This happens because the brain automatizes every activity you do repeatedly. For instance, you learn to drive when you're young. Unless you have in mind to be a rally pilot, once you master the ability required to have an average use of a car your improvement over the years will be minimum  compare to someone training to win a race. This is because you automatized your practice and barely think about it. if you ever have to drive a big truck. You will have to learn, practice and drive deliberately again. 

The key here is **deliberate practice**

**What's deliberate practice ?**

Imagine yourself one day having to drive a truck. It would be very uncomfortable despite you have years, maybe decades, driving regulars cars. Yet, if you keep driving enough, you will gain confidence in your ability day by day and eventually you would learn in this case to drive super heavy vehicles. 

So, let's say that in order to improve a skill you have to push yourself out of your comfort zone. The driving thing it's just to exemplify how you need yo embrace discomfort to improve in anything. 

Learn is painful yet pretty rewarding. As most of the things that worth in life. 

Here we have a formula to master any craft you want. 

**Mental representations**

- Re-create experiences

Do you remember our driving example? Think about how you did learn to park the car.

- Condense information

Getting the context of what you're learning is pretty important. 

**Purposeful practice** 

- Specific goal

You need to have a specific goal on order to know where you are; what to do; and, if you are getting it. 

- Intense focus

Neither distractions nor interruptions in your practice for a period of time. It's better an hour of intense focused work than three of a session full of interruptions.

- Immediate feedback

If we are practicing enough we will be failing continually. Getting immediate feedback we can iterate our efforts and improve little by little. After a certain period of time our improvement will be huge. 

- Frequent discomfort

If a session is uncomfortable that means you are learning, you are getting better. It is like a working out session. As it's commonly painted in a gym wall -  No pain no gain. 

**Expert coaching** 

It's not about how smart you are but the way you study or practice. With the right techniques and consistency ordinary people can achieve extraordinary results. 

Summarizing what makes a deliberate practice is a sum of purposeful practice and expert coaching.  Remember that to master a craft it's not about the time you invest in rather the quality and effectiveness of your efforts. 

**Creative Thinking Hacks**

Despite most people could think, software development is a creative craft. There are lots of solutions to solve a problem. You need to think creatively in order to find a good solution. So, as much creative person you become, you will be a better developer. I want to point out the verb **become.** Because creativity is an action. 

The idea among most of the people about creativity is that it is a kind of divine gift. There are creative people who born with that skill. You have it or don't. 

The first thing you need to have in mind is that creativity is a kind of work. 

These ideas were inspire by a video called Creative Thinking Hacks by Scott Berkun.

**Ideas are made of other ideas** 

**Combination**

Once a Journalist give me the advice to choose a writer I like, read their writings and try to emulate their writing style, so I could find my own style little by little. This is what combination is about. You cannot start from scratch in terms of creativity. You have to take what other have done before and mix their ideas, their style and so son. This is why musicians have influences. As Isaac Newton once said:

**Inhibition** 

Why children are more creative than adults? They do not seem to worry about taking a conventional course of direction when doing something. 

**Environment** 

I am writing this essay at 9:27pm. Why I am telling you this? Because I realize that I write better very early in the morning or at night. The ideas flow easily in my head at these times of the day. I could say I am more creative too. Therefore it is very important you know what environment you are more creative in. With this i mean the hour of the day. Your workspace, the music you listen to. There are many variables you can take advantage of in order to increase your creative outcome. 

**Persistence**

Bringing new ideas is not the critical part of the creative process. Many people say that hard work it's the most important part. Edison just to say that inspiration xxxx. Perhaps, he said that just to make clear the point that having a good idea it is just a part of the work. You still have to do the hard work. Ideas and hard work are both important for creative work. 

**Hacks** 

**Journal**  

Write down your ideas on paper and make this a habit. Ideas come and go away all day long. In order to catch up your ideas, you need to write them down, otherwise you will forget them. 

**Escape**

This is about escaping your common state of mind letting it relax and flow. Have you ever heard about the focused and diffuse mode in learning theory? Well, when you escape switching you focused state of mind into a relaxed one, your brain starts making connections and mixing stuff and this is where creativity comes from. 

**Invert**

Create a playful, positive, fun  environment when brainstorming. How can we do it? Invert the pressure of come up with great ideas to the opposite. Coming up with the worst, silly and stupid ideas can liberate people's creative thinking and set a good vibe in the room. Once you all get that state, switch over to a productive session.  

**Partner**

Bill Gates and Paul Allen. John Lennon and Paul McCarney.  Larry Brin and Sergey Paige. There are many examples of how finding a partner can create a synergic effect where 1 + 1 is not equals 2 is at least 3. 

**Fail**

Elon Musk says "If you're not failing, you are not innovating enough". 

Don't be afraid of failing. All creative and innovator people build up their brilliant ideas from failures.  

**Switch modes**

If you're stuck with an idea, change the way you represent it. For instance, you are struggling with a painting, try to write about what you wan to paint. Your are stuck with a algorithmic problem, represent it visually. 

**How the progress works**

**Change**

Overall, as home sapiens, we don't like change. For biological reasons, we are always trying to save energy and remain unchanged costs less energy than to change. It's a matter of survival instinct. 

If we look through history we can see that the largest changes were not about tools or technologies but people. There is no change until someone stakes their reputation on doing something different. 

We know that changing is so hard but how can we make to change happens?

These are some tactics taken from Scott Berkun:

- **Power:** What changes can you mandate?

The power you have and the change to want to make need to be lined up. 

- **Persuasion:** Whose support can you earn?

Selling is pretty important. It's not enough to have a brilliant idea. You still have to sell it. 

- **Intuition:** What can you anticipate?

Look for people who are willing to change. Most of the time are the people who are unhappy with their current situation. 

**Badass developer**

Our cognitive resources are scarce. We aren't humanoids with infinite energy to learn and work. Expertise requires energy management. Many activities during a day act as a leak of our cognitive resources. Therefore, it is a clever idea to know how to manage our efforts in the process of learning new things. 

 We can use a model to be more effective when learning what we need. In this model there are three stages:

[Stages model](https://www.notion.so/5075e52b2ad946fc868489e5c75fa760)

We need to move the most we can things from pileB to pileC so we can liberate cognitive resources to take things from pileA to pileB. This requires practice and, in order to do it efficiently, we can break a skill into smaller skills. 

For instance, take a skill from Can't Do to Mastered within maximum three sessions of 45-90 minutes each one. If it takes longer break it into two or three and learn one by one. 

Let's suppose we need to learn redux for a project which is a Javascript library to manage a global state in the frontend of an application and it is known for being hard to understand in the beginning. We can break the library into its main concepts: reducers, action creators and store. Then learn how each works first to make them easier to understand working together. 

**How to talk to anyone** 

It's pretty common that software developers are introvert kind of person. This means that communication with others it is not part of the things they enjoy the most. And, this is especially true for people they don't meet before with. Fortunately, there is room for improvement and optimization, and this is something devs enjoy a lot, therefore, talking to anyone is something that can be learned and hacked. 

**Why would I want to learn to talk to anyone if it is something I'm not interested?** 

Perhaps, this is a thought that could pop up in your mind. But, let me say that good communication with others is one of the most important skills you could have to be more effective and efficient in almost every activity. Even before the beginning of the firsts civilizations  we, humans, used to live in tribes, this was the only way to secure our survival. We are social animals. We just can explain the progress of humanity  by interaction, team work and communication among peers. 

Having in mind all of that, then it is a good idea to be a great communicator, so let's review some hacks I took from the Derek Sivers' notes of the book ***how to talk to anyone** by **Leil Lowdnes***. 

**Smile magically different**

Imagine you meet someone who look at your face for a second and then flash a big warm smile over your face. What would you feel? 

**Use you eyes to strike everyone as intelligent and insightful**

When you look away while talking to anyone do it slowly and reluctantly. Think as your eyes are glued to the person your talking to with sticky warm taffy. 

**Concentrate in your target with your look**

This shows a genuinely interest in the other person. Even if your target is not speaking show your interest looking at them. 

**How to respond when you don't want to answer?**

Someone asks you something you don't want to answer. So, you give a short response. If the other person keep questions more about that, just keep answering with the same short original response, with the same tone. 

**Make them feel you empathize with their talking**

Don't just say "yep", "yeah", "huh" - instead use phrases like "I see what you mean", "that's lovely thing to say" when the person you're talking with make a point. Doing this you make the other person feel you are interested of what they`re saying and want them to continue. 

**Be the chooser not the choose**

This may be especially hard, especially id the person you want to tall to is VIP. Because of the fear of being rejected it could be easy not to approach the people we want to meet. Having this in mind it is a good idea to practice in every social event, party, meetup so you will be ready when you have to. 

**Ideas worth nothing without execution** 

Once I watched in an interview Steve Jobs saying that an idea it's just 90 per cent of the work to make a great product. If we know a little about Apple history we could see that, Xerox was developing disruptive ideas in one of its labs in California called Xerox Parc. Steve Jobs and his team took the main ideas from xerox park and applied them to the first Macintosh which became the personal computer that revolutionized the use of a computer for most of the people. The mouse, the graphic interface, the desk among others were some of the ideas that the Macintosh team could execute successfully. Who remember the Xerox Star? which was the product Xerox launched with these ideas?

So we can say that ideas are multipliers of execution. 

[Copy of Quantitative Explanation:](https://www.notion.so/5e7a57ec03e8413c8fe8fb4a8ed4e386)

In our example of Apple and Xerox:

The brilliant ideas of xerox, with so-so execution, was worth $200, 000.

**The same brilliant ideas, with the Mac team great execution, was to be worth $20,000,000 and changed the world.**

**Technical overview of the week**

We live in  a time where we have access to the lessons of the best professors of the world; through online courses, lectures on youtube, blog posts and so on. We don't need to go to the elite universities to get high quality information and knowledge. For instance, you might have heard that Stanford University has one the best computer science programs of the world. Well, thanks to the internet we have a series of lessons from one of his professors. 

Here are my thoughts of some of them.

**The greatest performance improvement of all is when a system goes from not-working to working**

There are three criterions to have in mind before taking care of a program performance:

- Getting the program completed quickly
- Ensure the quality
- Manage the complexity

Therefore, the primary design criterion for software should be simplicity not speed. 

**Use your intuition to ask questions, not to answer them**

As a developer gets experience and deep knowledge they could start having gut-level feelings when discussing technical decisions. This intuition is great but they need to be careful of not taking their intuitions blindly. It is a better approach to takes your intuitions as hypothesis that need to be verified. An intuition should focus your analysis not replace it. 

**The most important component of evolution is death**

In social structures and biological organism, to change is too hard. Often it is easier to replace something than to change it. However, talking about software it is the otherwise. 

Have you ever heard about the financial system running on Cobol ?

In software it is easier to fix a program that replace it with a new development. But, this also makes difficult to make structural changes once the software it's shipped. Mistakes made in the early stages of the program tend to live forever. 

**Facts precede concepts**

In order to learn or understand unfamiliar areas you need to observe a large number of facts before trying to get the concept as a whole. This also applies when teaching. It's a good strategy to go from general to specific and then go back to general. Explain a concept then give lots of examples then show how they are related with the concept. 

**If you don't know what the problem was, you haven't fixed it**

When you're facing an issue unless you know the line that causes it you haven't fixed it, even if you make the program works. So, in order to solve a problem you have to understand it well. If you don't, the problem will remerge in few weeks or months. 

**If it hasn't been used, it doesn't work**

Software is not like a building you have to make an effort to build it once and that's it. All it requires are low maintenance over the years. Software is more like a garden that you need to take care of continuously. 

**The three most powerful words for building credibility are "I don't know"**

Don't be afraid to say "I don't know". As one of the apprenticeship patterns claims: build your reputation on how quickly you can learn something not in saying you know something when you don't know. 

**Coherent systems are inherently unstable**

We humans, tend to make coherent systems, this is the way our entire civilization was built-on. This makes our systems easy to predict, manipulate and improve. On the other hand, this also makes our systems unstable. For instance, it's easier to have one or to operating system because this way we just have to worry for making one or two versions of our apps. However this makes the system unstable since just a virus can infect most of the computers in the world. 

**Using the shell** 

Besides the graphical interface most of people use when working with computers there is a textual interface called the shell. One of the most popular is Bash - "Bourne Again SHell". Operating systems based on Unix like Linux and Mac OS have one installed. From here you can navigate, create, edit and remove files. Also have access to the system resources; it works as an environment to run programs; you can code scripts to automate tasks among other useful things. 

These are one of the basic commands to start using the shell

```bash
missing:~$ date
Fri 10 Jan 2020 11:49:31 AM EST
missing:~$
```

```bash
pwd      #To know where you are
ls       #To know the files inside the current directory
ls -a    #To see the hidden files of the current directory
ls -l    #To see the files in a long format
```

If you want to change directory you can use the command "cd" which comes from "Change Directory"

```bash
/home/projects/march_
cd first_week
/home/projects/march/first_week
```

If you want to go back

```bash
/home/projects/march/first_week
cd ..
/home/projects/march/
```

If you want to know see more information about a program's arguments, inputs, outputs, or how it works in general, you can use man. It takes as an argument the name of a program, and shows you its manual page. 

```bash
missing:~$ man ls
```

Last but not least I want to share the first sketch I have ever made to show visually the main points of a methodology Freshout uses. They have come with it trough several experiments and iterations. 

Following this constituted method reduces the number of errors in a project.
