# What I did learn - phase 1

A month ago it was my first day at the Nearsoft academy program. 

Here are my main reflections on the learnings, the experiences and the expectations of what it is coming in the next weeks. 

The main aim of the first phase is to reset your mind. You have to leave behind your pre conceptions of what it means to work in the software industry. 

So during this phase we mainly get ready to what it is coming in the next months. 

Looking backwards I can see that I have learned a lot. There have been lots of fun, stress, great experiences and most important I have met great people. 

Here I want to share my main learnings and insights during this first month. 

**Software development is more about people**

We need to stop thinking in the idea of the solo genius that after a week coding 24/7 straight comes up with an idea that changes the world. Perhaps, that could be true in the past but nowadays the development of software is a collaborative activity, thus it is critical to understand the importance of your ability to work with others to succeed professionally in this industry. 

**Doesn't matter what you don't know but how quickly you can learn**

It is impossible to know everything specially in this industry where everything is evolving so quickly. 

Fortunately, If you have the right study practices you can learn quickly the necessary knowledge that a project requires. Due to this it is a smart idea to develop a toolkit of effective strategies and habits. 

In this sense we learned first about developing habits. James Clear's work is great for this purpose,  through his posts and writings we plant the seed to have a system that makes us complete the program successfully. And not just the academy program. I t will be useful for the rest of our careers. 

Then the time to develop the meta-skill of learning came. We were ask to read the book "Make it stick" and taking the online course "Learning how to learn." These resources teach powerful tools to learn faster and better. I cannot remark enough the importance of develop an effective method of learning since we are in an career where we have to be life long learners. 

**You are not alone** 

During this phase there were difficult moments while completing the weekly assignments but we, all the academies, made pretty quickly a strong team where each of us is always willing to help to the other. I remember a day when some of us were close to a deadline. It was Monday night and many of us were together in a video call supporting to each other. Academy mates that had already finished helping to the ones that hadn't yet. It is amazing the commitment of everyone. 

**Nearsoft/Encora  is a great company** 

In the first week we had an activity which consists in interviewing randomly five developers. It was an  open activity since we were free to ask whatever we want. It amazed me that everyone is very friendly and with a positive attitude and willingness to help. 

Also, in the first two weeks we have onboarding sessions where we learn about the company, its story, values and culture. I love how a company can be oriented in people and how effective this can be for everyone. 

**The importance of having a mentor** 

This is one of the apprenticeship patterns to become a craftsman of software and we have it as part of the academy program which is great since each of us have two mentors. We can talk to them about the program and technical stuff. Having someone that already walked by the road you just started walking, and willing to help and share their knowledge and experience is invaluable.

**Everything is trainable** 

We had to give four talks about a subject we were free to choose. It could be about either technical or soft skills. The challenge was that they must be in English. Well it was a doubled challenge since, it is public speaking in English. I think I got more comfortable with every talk. Also, I think I improved in each  thanks to the feedback of my mentors. I think there is still a big room to make it better but this experience showed me how you can get better in something as long as you train on it 

**Time management** 

During the last weeks I've been trying different ways to organize my activities during the day. I think I have found the way to make my days more productive. This will be critical since in the next phase we will be working, in self-managed teams, building projects.  

The best of all is that this has been just the beginning and I am exited to see what's coming in the next phases. For now, I am about to begin the second phase which it's about building something from scratch in teams. It is going to be a great chance to try all of we have learned in the first phase and much more. And, of course, I will keep writing about it.
