# Professional debugger

We are in week 8 of the Nearsoft Academy program. This is the last week of the second phase, which is about building something from scratch in self-managed teams. Thus, here are my insights and takeaways of the week.

**Teamwork**

One of the goals of the program is to make us understand that software engineering is more about people than code by itself. In this phase, I realized the truth behind that statement. I can say that I was lucky to be part of a great team. We all have always the best attitude to learn, share, and to help each other. When working on a project I think one of the most critical parts is to form a solid team. We achieved that quickly and despite the hard times, we faced during the development of the project we remained united.

**Pragmatic programmer**

This week I started reading the book "Pragmatic programmer" which is a must-read for developers. I wanted to read it some months ago but it was expensive and I could not afford it at that time but luckily it is available in the library of the company so I will be reading it during the next weeks. So far, I have read about having a knowledge portfolio and why you should treat it as a financial one, with short and long-term investments. Low and high risks.

I will be talking more about this book in the next weeks.

**Ask for help**

Personally, I don't like asking for help, and being honest it is a matter of fear. Someway, I think that the other people have more important things to do, or perhaps that I could be rejected. Also, I like to solve my problems on my own. But, I realized how important it is to ask for help from more experienced people. You could learn implicit things that would be hard to know by yourself. Also, that could help you to save valuable time when you are close to a deadline. I think the rule could be no spend more than one hour stuck in a problem since that means that you lack some fundamental knowledge so it is better to ask for help.

**Debugging**

I read in the pragmatic programmer book that you can't be a great programmer if you aren't an excellent debugger. I realized this is especially true this week. In the presentation of our third demo, we realized we had some bugs in our application. For a couple of days, we focused on fixing those bugs. I learned that chrome dev tools are your best allies to accomplish a successful process of debugging.

I will be taking an online course during the next weeks to know more about those tools. I think it can make a huge difference in your effectiveness as a frontend developer and professional debugger.

**Last thoughts**

The second phase of the Nearsoft Academy program has been such a great experience. It was challenging but pretty rewarding. The last week was especially hard but also fun. I have made great friends who I can learn from. Also, I have improved my technical skills a lot. It is amazing how much I have learned in the last four weeks.

All I can say is that I cannot wait for the next phase of the NS academy program.
