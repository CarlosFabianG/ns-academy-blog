This week is the beginning of a new phase of the Nearsoft Academy program. It is the third phase and it is about contributing to an open-source project. As we know, one of the goals of this internship is to turn recent graduates into world-class software engineers. Well, contributing to open source is part of the world-class standard in the industry. Thus, this phase is critical in the growth of all of us as interns.

Specifically, this week was like the introduction to the open-source world. And, as I have been doing in the last couple of months, I would like to share my learnings and takeaways of the week.

Let's start.

### **What is an open-source contribution?**

Nowadays, the most used technologies in software development are open source projects. This means that it is a software you have access to its source code. You can clone, modify, improve, and enhanced it.

These projects have been build and maintain by a community of developers around the world. That's what open source contribution is about. Collaborate in the maintenance of these projects along with other developers.

### **How to contribute to open source projects**

When someone asks a great developer a piece of advice to improve your code skills contributing to open source is one the most given. I have heard that several times from the greatest developers. It is also a way to give back to the community.

To start, you can search for open source projects on Github, that's what I did this week to start getting the context of what it means to contribute to a project.

One of the first things I did was to see the repositories of popular open-source projects, like react js, redux, materialize, and so on. Read the issues and conversation in the chat. I have to admit that it is intimating at first because I did not understand most of the issues; also, there were long conversations on each. But it was a good first approach.

Next, I forked and clone some projects to see the source code in my editor and see how it works, overall.

### **Pragmatic programmer**

This book is great, I have been reading it for a week and I've got great insights from it. It is like the field manual for every developer who wants to be a great professional. Specifically, this week I want to dive into the section about entropy.

- What is entropy in software development?

Entropy is about how much disorder can exist in a system. It is a physics concept that applies as well to software development. We as developers need to win against entropy.

The book talks about what is known as the "broken window" factor. It's something that researchers found when investigating the factor that increments criminal rates in some neighborhoods. If I remember well, Malcolm Gladwell in his book "The tipping point" talks about this as well.

A simple broken window in a building can start the deteriorating of the building and then of the neighborhood.

Talking about software development a broken window, it could be code not well written, has the potential to start disorder in the codebase. That's why it is so important to maintain great quality even close to a deadline. Also, it is critical to fix something you see poorly written.

When a code is well written, elegant, and organized there is no room for a broken window, so every developer that works on it will be careful not to mess it up.

### **Next JS**

I just made this blog site this week. It was built with NextJS that is a javascript framework based on React. As we know, React is just a library, unlike Angular or Vue.js that are complete solutions for frontend development React needs to be set up with other tools to build an application ready for production. But, react.js is such great technology, it has a great community behind it, so, it is so popular, currently.

That's why a framework like NextJS exists. It gives us a complete solution based on React. This means that we build our applications as we normally do with React. Plus, we have some extra relevant features. Also, we don't have to worry about optimizations and configurations with bundlers like webpack.

Reading the docs to know how to build this blog, l learned important concepts like the following:

- **Pre-rendering**

A disadvantage of Single Page Applications is that the first rendering is slow since lots of javascript code needs to be load by the browser. Pre-rendering allows us to load an initial HTML and CSS pretty fast while javascript is loading behind. That gives the user a quick first rendering. NextJS uses pre-rendering to add great performance to our applications which is critical for a great user experience. Also, this technique improves the SEO of our websites.

- **Hydration**

This concept is related to the last one. It is when the browser loads the javascript code so the component page is fully operational.

- **Static site generation**

The first time I heard about static site generation was when I knew about a framework called gatsby.js. I used it in the past to

### **Going deeply into React JS**

When we use a framework o library for the first time we could think about it as magic. A black box that makes your development simpler. Although, the goal of a framework is to abstract the complexity in the development of an application, knowing how the abstraction works under the hood will give you a solid understanding of the technology. That will help you when solving problems, debugging, applying best practices, and so on. Moreover, you won't depend on a tool. You will be able to contribute to the existing ones.

Knowing the last, this week I decided to see how the magic of react js happens under the hood. This was part of one of the assignments of this phase: research about how a specific functionality works revisiting the source code.

### **Learning is not linear**

Once you understand that learning is not a linear process you gain patience. When you start learning something, you make initial great progress then when things get more complex you get stuck. You could feel that you are neither learning nor improving for weeks. Even you could feel that you understand less than you thought. But, the key is to keep trying even if it seems you are not making progress, all of the sudden, all the dots connect each other and you make a quantum leap in your understanding.

That's normal in any new craft you decide to learn. I think that has happened to me several times while learning to code. Now, I'm interested in learning more complex subjects. I'm ready to get stuck.

### **Last thoughts**

I have begun the new phase motivated to make a better job than the one I've made so far. There's always room for improvement. Although I still have so much to learn, I am determined to improve my routines, study sessions, overall everything related to my growth as a developer. I want to focus more on backend development in the following weeks, so I will be learning more about java and spring framework. Also, I would like to go back to the fundamentals of computer science since it will important for the next phase and I want to be prepared.
