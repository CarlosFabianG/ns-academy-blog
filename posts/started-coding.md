# Started coding 

We are in the week 6 of the Nearsoft academy program. In this week, after planning, we started building the project of the second phase. There were lots of challenges during the week as well as learnings. 

First of all, I could say that programming is like being an athlete. You have to make it an habit and do it most of your days. As an athlete training almost every day to maintain a high performance. I say this because I realized how easily you can lost the rhytym of programming in just weeks. At least in the beggining of your career I think it is a good idea to keep consistency in your practice. 

After this initial reflection I want to share my specific learnings of this week. Hope not to forget some. 

**PosgresSQL** 

I  learned a bit of SQL language a year ago. However, I never applied that knowledge to a project. This week I started an online course to learn databe designing using PosgreSQL which is a OMR. A Database Management System. 

I have had worked more with non-relational databses as Mongodb before. But, to learn SQL I have heard its's a must for everyone in the industry. Mosltly, because it is very useful. 

So far, I have re-learned how to create tables, what it is a record, a column and how they can relate to other tables. 

Also, I did some basics queries. But, the most important knowledge so far has been the conceptual one since I needed to work with my team in the design of our indetities in uor project. 

Next week I will keep practicing a more complex queries and I would like to dive a bit more into the theory. 

**Typescript**

In the project we are using typescript, probably you have heard about typescript. What is it exactly? It is a new language?  A Javascript evolution? Well, according to its official website Typescript is a superset of Javascript. In other words, it adds a static typed system among other powers. Ts has been becoming popular year by year so you cannot go wrong with it. 

**Deliberate practice** 

I keep reading the book Peak - by Andy Ericson. I talked about it last week. Being honest the week was hard and I did not have the time to read as much as I wished but the good part it is that I have had time to digest the idea of the book which is to reach a high peak of performance in a skill by practicing effectively. In this sense, I have been thinking in a way to 

**Pair progamming** 

Pair programing is a technique that is part of the agile methodologies in the software development. In this week I have paired with one of my teammates to work on a ticket of the project. I really enjoy to learn and to teach so this practice it's great for both purposes. I can learn from my team mates at the same time I can teach them what I know. 

**No surprises** 

One of the main goals of the NS academy program is to make us understand that software development is more about people than computers of code by itself. Thus, communication is critical in this sense. During the week I learned the value of the communication rule of no surprises which means basically, communicate when you have a problem that can become a blocker to reach the objectives of a sprint. I was close to have an issue in this matter, fortunately, 

**Learning is non-linear** 

I watched during the week an interview of one of my heroes in the software development world. Guillermo Rauch is the CEO of vercel which is a company that provides an infraestructure that allows you to deploy your websites from the command line. Also, he wrote the library [socket.io](http://socket.io), he's co-creator of Next.js and moTools and currently  he is one of the main embassadors of the JAM stack concept. Well, after this introduction, the point it is that during the interview he mention that his proccess of learning in the begginning was never linear. One day he started to learn C language, the other day Linux, the after that, Javascript and so on. That was pretty interesting to me since I think that in the last months that has been my way of learning. I have tried to learn many things to get a wider context of every part of the software development cycle. As Guillermo says in the interview it depends of your style of learning. Also, in the stage of your career, perhaps in the future I will specialize in some technologies but for now I will be learning as much as I can of everything. 

**Last thoughts** 

To tell you the truth this week has been so hard. Probably, the hardest in the NS academy so far. However, it was pretty rewarding and fun. I cannot wait to see the challenges ahead. I commited myself to keep working hard in both my soft and hard skills since **consistency > talent.**
